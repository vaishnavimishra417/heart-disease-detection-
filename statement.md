# Project Statement

## Problem Statement

Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early
detection is essential for preventing severe health complications.
Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and require expert
interpretation. There is a need for a data-driven system that can
analyze patient health parameters and predict the likelihood of heart
disease efficiently and accurately.

## Project Description

This project aims to build a machine learning-based prediction system
using the Heart Disease UCI dataset. The model analyzes medical
attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type,
and maximum heart rate to classify whether a patient is likely to have
heart disease.

2. Scope of the Project
Help patients and doctors to detect diseases rapidly and correctly 
The scope of this project is that it will collect the data and then it will help us to detect heart disease
​In-Scope:
​Collection and preprocessing of the Heart Disease dataset (cleaning, normalization, encoding).
​Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature correlations.
​Implementation of a Machine Learning classification algorithm (Random Forest).
​Development of a prediction script that accepts user input (clinical features).
​Evaluation of the model using standard metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
​Out-of-Scope:
​Integration with real-time hardware sensors or wearable devices.
​Deployment as a fully hosted commercial web application (scope is limited to local execution/prototype).
​Providing definitive medical diagnoses (the system is for decision support only).
​3. Target Users
​Medical Professionals (Doctors/Nurses): To use as a supplementary decision-support tool for quick risk assessment during patient consultations.
​Medical Researchers: To analyze patterns and correlations between different physiological attributes and heart disease.
​General Public: For educational purposes and self-awareness regarding heart health risk factors based on their own health data.
​4. High-Level Features
​Clinical Data Input: A structured interface to input key patient details such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
​Intelligent Prediction Engine: A robust Random Forest classifier that processes input data to predict the likelihood of heart disease (Binary Classification: Healthy vs. Disease).
​Performance Analytics: Generation of detailed performance reports, including confusion matrices and classification reports, to validate the reliability of the predictions.
​Data Visualization: Visual representation of key health indicators and model performance metrics to aid interpretability.
