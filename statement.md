# Project Statement

## Problem Statement

Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early
detection is essential for preventing severe health complications.
Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and require expert
interpretation. There is a need for a data-driven system that can
analyze patient health parameters and predict the likelihood of heart
disease efficiently and accurately.

## Project Description

This project aims to build a machine learning-based prediction system
using the Heart Disease UCI dataset. The model analyzes medical
attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type,
and maximum heart rate to classify whether a patient is likely to have
heart disease.

Python and Google Colab are used for implementation, with data
preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation forming the
core workflow. The Logistic Regression algorithm is applied to achieve
an accuracy of approximately 80--85%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
machine learning in medical diagnostics.

The project showcases how machine learning techniques can support
healthcare professionals by providing fast and reliable predictions,
enabling early diagnosis and improved patient care.
